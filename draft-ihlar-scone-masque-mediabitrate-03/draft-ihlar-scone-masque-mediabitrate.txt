1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an HTTP Capsule (RFC9297) that can be used
   with CONNECT-UDP (RFC9298), CONNECT-IP (RFC9484), or other future
   CONNECT extensions to signal throughput advice for traffic proxied
   through an HTTP server.

   The extension can be used with the HTTP CONNECT method when the
   :protocol pseudo-header is equal to "connect-udp" or "connect-ip", as
   well as with future CONNECT protocols that use the Capsule Protocol.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Indicating Support for Throughput Advice Signaling

   A client that wishes to receive throughput advice capsules can
   indicate support by sending a request header with the boolean-valued
   Item Structured Field: "Throughput-Advice: ?1".  The HTTP proxy can
   indicate support by sending a response header with the same boolean-
   valued Item Structured Field: "Throughput-Advice: ?1".  See
   Section 3.3.6 of [RFC8941] for information about the boolean format.

   Once support has been established, a proxy MAY send THROUGHPUT_ADVICE
   capsules at any time during the lifetime of the stream that
   originated the request.

4.  THROUGHPUT_ADVICE Capsule Type Format

   The THROUGHPUT_ADVICE Capsule has the following format:

   THROUGHPUT_ADVICE Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0xTBD,
     Length (i),
     Direction (8),
     Rate Limit (i),
     [Average Window (i)]
   }

   The capsule has the following fields:

   Direction: Indicates the traffic direction to which this throughput
   advice applies.  Valid values are:

   *  0x00: Both uplink and downlink

   *  0x01: Uplink (client to target)

   *  0x02: Downlink (target to client)

   A client MUST treat any other value as a malformed capsule.

   Rate Limit: The maximum sustainable throughput that the client can
   expect for proxied traffic, expressed in kilobits per second.

   Average Window: Indicates the duration over which the bitrate is
   enforced, expressed in milliseconds.  If this field is omitted the
   average window is assumed to be 67 seconds as described in
   Section 5.2 of [SCONE].

5.  Relationship to the SCONE Protocol

   This document reuses the SCONE [SCONE] conceptual model for
   throughput advice but scopes signaling to the HTTP tunnel between a
   MASQUE client and a MASQUE server.  When the Throughput-Advice header
   is successfully negotiated, the MASQUE server is the entity that
   originates THROUGHPUT_ADVICE capsules toward the client; the client
   does not send capsules unless specified by future extensions.

   Implementations that negotiate Throughput-Advice for a MASQUE tunnel
   SHOULD NOT initiate or forward SCONE packets on the outer MASQUE
   connection for the purpose of conveying throughput advice.

   When a MASQUE proxy observes SCONE packets that belong to an end-to-
   end inner flow carried by the tunnel, the proxy MUST forward those
   packets unmodified.

5.1.  Interaction with QUIC-Aware Forwarding

   When used in combination with QUIC-Aware Forwarding [QUIC-PROXY],
   QUIC long-header packets are tunnelled rather than being forwarded
   forwarded directly.  Since SCONE packets use a dedicated QUIC version
   and the long-header format, they will be encapsulated automatically
   inside the MASQUE tunnel.

6.  Applicability

   A proxy that intends to rate limit proxied traffic can notify clients
   using the THROUGHPUT_ADVICE capsule.  Reasons for rate limiting
   traffic through a proxy include enforcement of access network
   policies, proxy resource management and proxy service
   differentiation.

   If the sole purpose of the communication between a client endpoint
   and a network element is the exchange of throughput advice, it is
   RECOMMENDED to use more lightweight approaches than HTTP proxying,
   such as [SCONE].

6.1.  Applicability to Proxied Applications

   In most MASQUE deployments, the client that terminates the HTTP
   tunnel is not the ultimate endpoint of the application traffic.
   Throughput advice therefore applies to the aggregate traffic carried
   by the tunnel rather than to any individual application flow.

   How a MASQUE client exposes throughput advice to the applications
   that use the tunnel is out of scope for this document.
   Implementations may, for example:

   *  Use the advice to apply back-pressure on proxied traffic;

   *  Forward the information through an out-of-band API or control
      channel; or

   *  Adjust sending behavior on behalf of the application.

   For CONNECT-UDP requests, the advice typically corresponds to the
   throughput of a single proxied flow, whereas for CONNECT-IP requests
   it applies to the aggregate traffic within the tunnel.

7.  Security Considerations

   Throughput advice influences application sending behavior and can
   therefore affect performance and user experience.  Implementations
   MUST treat such signals as advisory information.  A malicious or
   misconfigured proxy could advertise unrealistically low rate limits
   to degrade service quality or influence path selection and traffic
   distribution.  Clients MAY ignore any received advice.

   When QUIC-Aware Forwarding is in use, SCONE packets are encapsulated
   as QUIC long-header packets and therefore not visible to on-path
   observers.  This encapsulation is RECOMMENDED since it prevents
   correlation between throughput-advice signaling and proxied
   application traffic.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Capsule types

   This document adds following entries to the "HTTP Capsule Types"
   registry:

              +===================+=======+=================+
              | Capsule Type      | Value | Specification   |
              +===================+=======+=================+
              | THROUGHPUT_ADVICE | TBD   | (This document) |
              +-------------------+-------+-----------------+

                   Table 1: New Capsule Type to register

8.2.  HTTP headers

   This document adds following entry to the "Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry":

    +===================+==========+===========+===========+==========+
    | Field Name        | Template | Status    | Reference | Comments |
    +===================+==========+===========+===========+==========+
    | Throughput-Advice |          | permanent | (This     |          |
    |                   |          |           | document) |          |
    +-------------------+----------+-----------+-----------+----------+
