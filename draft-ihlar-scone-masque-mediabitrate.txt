            MASQUE extension for signaling throughput advice
              draft-ihlar-scone-masque-mediabitrate-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a new Capsule (RFC9297) that can be used with
   CONNECT-UDP (RFC9298), CONNECT-IP (RFC9484), or other future CONNECT
   extensions to signal throughput advice for traffic that is proxied
   through an HTTP server.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an HTTP Capsule (RFC9297) that can be used
   with CONNECT-UDP (RFC9298), CONNECT-IP (RFC9484), or other future
   CONNECT extensions to signal throughput advice for traffic proxied
   through an HTTP server.

   The extension can be used with the HTTP CONNECT method when the
   :protocol pseudo-header is equal to "connect-udp" or "connect-ip", as
   well as with future CONNECT protocols that use the Capsule Protocol.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Indicating Support for Throughput Advice Signaling

   A client that wishes to receive throughput advice capsules can
   indicate support by sending a request header with the boolean-valued
   Item Structured Field: "Throughput-Advice: ?1".  The HTTP proxy can
   indicate support by sending a response header with the same boolean-
   valued Item Structured Field: "Throughput-Advice: ?1".  See
   Section 3.3.6 of [RFC8941] for information about the boolean format.

   Once support has been established, a proxy MAY send THROUGHPUT_ADVICE
   capsules at any time during the lifetime of the stream that
   originated the request.

4.  THROUGHPUT_ADVICE Capsule Type Format

   The THROUGHPUT_ADVICE Capsule has the following format:

   THROUGHPUT_ADVICE Capsule {
     Type (i) = 0xTBD,
     Length (i)
     Rate Limit (i)
     [Average Window (i)]
   }

   The capsule has the following fields:

   Rate Limit: The maximum sustainable throughput that the client can
   expect for proxied traffic, expressed in kilobits per second.

   Average Window: Indicates the duration over which the bitrate is
   enforced, expressed in milliseconds.  This field is optional.

5.  Applicability

   A proxy that intends to rate limit proxied traffic can notify clients
   using the THROUGHPUT_ADVICE capsule.  Reasons for rate limiting
   traffic through a proxy include enforcement of access network
   policies, proxy resource management and proxy service
   differentiation.

   If the sole purpose of the communication between a client endpoint
   and a network element is the exchange of throughput advice, it is
   RECOMMENDED to use more lightweight approaches than HTTP proxying,
   such as [TRONE].

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Capsule types

   This document adds following entries to the "HTTP Capsule Types"
   registry:

              +===================+=======+=================+
              | Capsule Type      | Value | Specification   |
              +===================+=======+=================+
              | THROUGHPUT_ADVICE | TBD   | (This document) |
              +-------------------+-------+-----------------+

                   Table 1: New Capsule Type to register

7.2.  HTTP headers

   This document adds following entry to the "Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry":

    +===================+==========+===========+===========+==========+
    | Field Name        | Template | Status    | Reference | Comments |
    +===================+==========+===========+===========+==========+
    | Throughput-Advice |          | permanent | (This     |          |
    |                   |          |           | document) |          |
